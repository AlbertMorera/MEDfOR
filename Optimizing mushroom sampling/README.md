## Introduction

Mushroom sampling is essential for estimating natural ecosystem biodiversity, as well as for understanding the functioning and assessing the ecosystem services of our forests. 

However, in-situ mushroom sampling is a costly and resource-intensive process. An optimization and rethinking of sampling techniques could save a lot of time and money.

In this master thesis we will try to relate the number of mushrooms, their dry biomass and their wet biomass and how these relationships are modulated by meteorological conditions, in order to optimize mushroom sampling. For this we will use the largest mushroom database in the world and the state-of-the-art modeling techniques to achieve our objectives.


## Objectives
- Relate the number of carpophores to mushroom biomass.
- Relate dry biomass to wet biomass of fungi.
- Determine the meteorological conditions that modulate these relationships.

The objectives are not fixed, but subject to the interests and motivation of the master's student.

This master thesis has the possibility to be published in a scientific journal if the student and the results encourage it.


## Skills to be developed
- Knowledge of fungal ecology
- Writing scientific articles
- Programming using R language
- Statistical modeling and/or modeling based on Machine Learning


## Methodology
For this master thesis we will use the largest mushroom database in the world (property of the Universitat de Lleida), with information on weekly mushroom production resulting from a network of more than 100 permanent sampling plots distributed throughout Catalonia. 
Statistical modeling or machine learning techniques (to be agreed), high resolution meteorological data and RStudio software will be used to meet the objectives of the master thesis.
